# SVM_example_IRIS_DATA
Used SVM in IRIS_data, 
IRIS_data set is imported from sklearn.datasets, 
Created different models with diffrenet kernals which include "linear","poly","rbf","sigamoid" and found best model, 
Heatmap was used for the visualisation, 
Hyperplane was plotted, fo rthat pupose PCA(Principal Component Analysis) was used to reduce the dimensionality.
